support data types with restrictions
  STRING [from LIST | without CHARLIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
    satisfying function means that f(STRING) returns TRUE for valid settings,
    and f is a user defined funcPtr
  INTEGER [from RANGE or LIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
  REAL [from RANGE or LIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
  STRINGLIST [from LIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
  INTEGERLIST [from LIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
  REALLIST [from LIST | satisfying FUNCTION]
  BOOLEAN [TRUE, YES, ON | FALSE, NO, OFF]
  
The code should handle settings lines such as
NUMERICAL_KEY = DEFAULT
where DEFAULT could be one of many defaults; if an explicit numerical value is passed, this should be checked against RANGE or another FROMLIST
